This site is a collaborative effort to build a set of shared principles for an electoral alliance across a number of UK political parties.

We agree on the following:

* Radical Devolution Policy - Regional and Local in England
* Electoral Reform
* Fairer Taxation
* A more balanced Economy across Britain
* Better-funded public service provision - Health, Social Care etc

We agree to focus on consensus politics and agreeing the best way forward, as opposed to entrenched views on policy. We should debate the merits of policy from across the spectrum and explore the best way to implement.

We strive to agree and commit on areas to stand candidates and avoid cross-boundary conflicts.
